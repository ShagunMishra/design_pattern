Simple patterns designs to learn concept of looping in C++

This is the simple project based on concept of for loops.

One of the best way to learn loops is drawing patterns,
I had completed this project when I was in 12th standard.

In past days when I had started to learn programming, I came to know
looping is the best way to start..that's why I learned and explain little bit..
on the link.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxoq-dZQIiI&t=64s 

In this project different options were given for different patterns,
basically 6 options were there, as follows:

1. To print pattern of upward pyramid:
   Whenever we choose this option two upward pyramid will came into picture->
   a) Full filled upward pyramid
   b) Full hollow upward pyramid
   
2. To print pattern of downward pyramid:
   Whenever we choose this option two downward pyramid will came into picture->
   a) Full filled downward pyramid
   b) Full hollow downward pyramid

3. To print pattern of diamond:
   Whenever we choose this option two downward pyramid will came into picture->
   a) Full filled diamond
   b) Full hollow diamond

4. To print pattern of star:
   Whenever we choose this option pattern of star came into picture->
   In centre of star there is pattern of diamond 
   coding of this pattern is shown in link..

5. To print beautiful pattern:
   Whenever we choose this potion two patterns came into picture->
   a) Diamond with cross
   b) Hollow diamond with dot in centre
   
6. To Exit:
   From here we out from the project
   
After every option jump statment is used so that user can continue from given options
again if user want by typing y or n

Thats solve for explaination..
Thanku
